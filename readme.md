# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling Project

## About This Project
This project is all about working with real-world messy data. I used Twitter data from the WeRateDogs account to clean, combine, and analyze tweets to find interesting patterns and insights about dog ratings and engagement.

## What I Worked On
- Collected data from different sources (CSV, TSV, and JSON)
- Checked data quality and tidiness issues
- Cleaned and merged datasets into one usable dataset
- Analyzed and visualized the data to find trends
- Summarized findings in a simple and clear way

## Dataset Info
The data comes from the **WeRateDogs (@dog_rates)** Twitter account, which is known for rating dogs in a fun and unique way (ratings usually go above 10/10 ).

The project uses three datasets:
- `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`
- `image_predictions.tsv`
- `tweet_json.txt`

All datasets are already included in the project folder.
